# R-Graphing-Project
This assignment uses data from the 
UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, a popular repository for machine learning datasets. In particular, we will be using the “Individual household electric power consumption Data Set” which I have made available on the course web site:

Description: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.

The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the 
UCI web site:

  1. Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy

  2. Time: time in format hh:mm:ss

  3. Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)

  4. Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
  
  5. Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)

  6. Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)

  7. Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).

  8. Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.

  9. Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.

## Summary
1. Download Dataset
2. Load data and extract data from 2007-2-1 to 2007-2-2
3. Modify variables classes appropriate for making plots
4. Make plots and save plots

## Problem
In plot3 and plot4, legend in PNG file is cut off...please look at my PNG file.
In window screen, there is no problem at legend, but when I save images, problem happens.
I think problem appears when setting images for certain size.
